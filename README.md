<h1><b>Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)</h1></b>

<h2> Aim: To create a visualization dashboard for a past hw assignment. </h2>

<h1><b>Website Requirements</h1></b>

<h3><b>The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:</h3></b>

<h4><b>A landing page containing:</h4></b>
  <p>An explanation of the project.
  <p>Links to each visualizations page.
    
<h4><b>Four visualization pages, each with:</h4></b>
<p>A descriptive title and heading tag.
<p>The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
<p>A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

<h4><b>A "Comparisons" page that:</h4></b>
<p>Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
<p>Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
<p>The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

<h4><b>A "Data" page that:</h4></b>
<p>Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
<p>The table must be a bootstrap table component.
<p>The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. You may use a csv-to-html table conversion tool, e.g. ConvertCSV.
  
<h4><b>The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:</h4></b>
<p>Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
<p>Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
<p>Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
<p>Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
  
<h4><b>Finally, the website must be deployed to github pages.</h4></b>

<p>When finished, submit to BootcampSpot the links to 1) the deployed app and 2) the github repository.<p>
